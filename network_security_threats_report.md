Common Network Security Threats
1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
DoS attacks flood a system with traffic to make it unavailable.

Impact: System crashes, service outages
Real Example: GitHub experienced a 1.35 Tbps attack in 2018
Prevention: Firewalls, rate limiting, DDoS protection services
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
An attacker intercepts communication between two systems.

Impact: Data theft, session hijacking
Example: Eavesdropping on unsecured Wi-Fi
Prevention: Use HTTPS, VPNs, TLS encryption
3. IP Spoofing
An attacker sends packets pretending to be a trusted source.

Impact: Unauthorized access, launching DoS attacks
Prevention: Packet filtering, authentication, intrusion detection
